02015-02016 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Junior Linguist

I performed linguistic annotation, corrections, and data analysis for various NLP projects, including syntactic parsing, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), coreference resolution, word sense disambiguation, and text summarization.

See [this Wired article](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/googles-search-engine-can-now-answer-questions-human-help/) for more information about the team I worked with.

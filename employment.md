# Employment

## Linguist Intern, Google, Inc.

*June 02020 &ndash; August 02020*

I built an open-source text normalization pipeline using Pynini, a Python library for compiling finite-state grammars, to evaluate different approaches to normalization as well as the quality of existing data sets for a selection of low-resource languages of Africa. View [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/googleinterns/text-norm-for-low-resource-languages).

## Chatbot Intern, Nextiva

*May 02018 &ndash; August 02018*

I used the Rasa toolkit to help develop a company-internal chatbot. Tasks included creating training data for the chatbot's language model and dialog model, running and comparing different models, and experimenting with new components for the chatbot.

## Junior Linguist, Adecco at Google

*September 02015 &ndash; July 02016*

I performed linguistic annotation, corrections, and data analysis for various NLP projects, including syntactic parsing, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), coreference resolution, word sense disambiguation, and text summarization.

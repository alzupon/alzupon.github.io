## Current Projects

### Scottish Gaelic Part-of-Speech tagger

As a final project for Mihai Surdeanu's Statistical NLP course I developed a part-of-speech tagger for Scottish Gaelic, a low-resource language. My (still rough) implementation achieves over 80% accuracy on overall tags and over 22% accuracy on unknown words using an LSTM neural network. Prior work by Lamb and Danso (2014) only achieves 76.6% accuracy on the same dataset, using a Brill bigram tagger.

A link to the project is forthcoming.

## A Corpus Analysis of Breton Soft-Mutation Irregularities

#### Collaborative work with Adam King, Colleen Patton, Michael Hammond, and Andrew Carnie
##### Accepted to present at Typologi ar Brezhoneg (Typology of Breton) conference in June 02018.

Traditional Breton grammars state where the soft mutation should and should not occur (Hemon 1995). Using an online Breton corpus (Eckart and Quasthoff 2013), we investigate how often the soft mutation actually surfaces. We focus on the mutation triggers ‘da’, ‘daou’, ‘div’, ‘holl’, ‘pa’, ‘pe’, and ‘re’, which should always trigger the soft mutation, and on mutation targets beginning with \<m>, \<p>, \<t>, \<k>, and \<gw>, which should all undergo the soft mutation. We also look at \<d>-initial targets after definite and indefinite articles. We find variation across the board, with \<p> in particular standing out.

Three patterns emerge from our study. First, all triggers fail to cause mutation some of the time. ‘pe’ causes mutation less frequently than the others. Second, the frequency of mutation varies with the initial consonant of the target. \<p>-initial targets mutate the least. Finally, we observe \<d>-initial targets mutating to \<z> after articles, where \<d> is prescriptively immune to mutation. These findings show that the prescriptive rules for the soft mutation are not rigidly followed; some triggers fail to cause mutation, and some immune targets nevertheless undergo mutation. A similar phenomenon is observed in Scottish Gaelic (Hammond et al. 2017).


## Scottish Gaelic Part-of-Speech tagger

Read it [here](https://alzupon.github.io/files/zupon_taggingSG.pdf)!

As a final project for Mihai Surdeanu's Statistical NLP course I developed a part-of-speech tagger for Scottish Gaelic, a low-resource language. My implementation achieves over 80% accuracy on overall tags and over 22% accuracy on unknown words using an LSTM neural network. Prior work by Lamb and Danso (2014) only achieves 76.6% accuracy on the same dataset, using a Brill bigram tagger.

A link to the full project is forthcoming.


## Icelandic Quirky Agreement Restrictions (MA Thesis)

Read it [here](https://alzupon.github.io/files/zupon_ma_thesis.pdf)!

This thesis proposes a novel defective T analysis for explaining two facts about Icelandic quirky subject sentences. First, in Icelandic quirky subject sentences, the verb agrees with the nominative object rather than with the subject. Second, 1st and 2nd person nominative objects are blocked completely in Icelandic quirky subject sentences.

Based in a Minimalist Program framework, I argue that T in quirky subject sentences is phi-defective, lacking \[Person\]. I also describe three potential alternative Minimalist analyses of Icelandic: (i) a phi-stacking analysis based on Richards’ case-stacking; (ii) a complex dependency analysis from López; and (iii) a split phi probe analysis supported by Sigurðsson and Holmberg. All of these alternatives come with additional theoretical baggage that makes them suboptimal for explaining the quirky Icelandic facts. I also show how previous analyses of Icelandic all fail to adequately explain the data.


## Restrictions on Denominal Verb Formation (BA Thesis)

Read it [here](https://alzupon.github.io/files/zupon_ba_thesis.pdf)!

Why can one say _shelve the books_ but not _desk the papers_? Only certain noun roots typically become denominal verbs. In this thesis I analyze the distribution of denominal verbs in English and restrictions on their formation. I argue that denominal verbs have an additional pragmatic component which is broadly tied to manner, encyclopedic knowledge, or real world typicalities. Shelving books has different connotations than simply putting books on a shelf, whereas there is no equivalent secondary meaning relating to placing objects on a desk. There are two sides to this analysis. The first is that the restrictions on denominal verb formation are an effect of the process itself. In this view, any noun root could undergo this process, but the derived denominal verb will be licit only if extra meaning is associated with the action. This analysis rests in formal pragmatics. The second analysis is that this additional meaning component is a part of the noun root itself, and the presence of such a component becomes realized in the formation of denominal verbs. The presence of this component on individual noun roots can be argued from lexically-similar pairs of words such as _can/jar_, where only one undergoes the denominal verb formation process.

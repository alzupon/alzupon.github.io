# About Me

I am a fourth year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Arizona, where I also received an MS in Human Language Technology. Before coming to Arizona, I worked as a Junior Linguist at Google in Mountain View, CA. Prior to that, I received an MA in Linguistics and a BA in Linguistics and Spanish (with a minor in Russian) from the University of Utah.

My two main research interests are computaitonal linguistics and theoretical syntax.

In the theoretical domain, my interests include:
1. Case (especially Quirky case)
2. Agreement (especially agreement 'failures')
3. Word order (especially V2)
4. How 1-3 interact with each other

My other main research area is computational linguistics. In the computational domain, my interests include:
1. Developing computational tools for low-resource languages
2. Applying computational methods to theoretical linguistic research
3. Applying theoretical linguistic knowledge to computational linguistics problems

Some of the languages I am interested in:
- Breton
- Scottish Gaelic
- Icelandic
- Faroese
- Kashmiri
- Ingush
- Tohono O'odham
- Romansh

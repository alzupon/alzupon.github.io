I am a linguist.


Currently, I am a PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Arizona, where I work on computational linguistics for low-resource and endangered languages as well as theoretical syntax. You can learn more about my general interests (academic and non-academic) on my [About Me](aboutme.md) page, or you can take a look at some of the specific projects I've been working on on my [Projects](projects.md) page.

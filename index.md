I am a linguist.

I am currently a PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.linguistics.arizona.edu) at the [University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu). Before starting the PhD program, I worked as a Junior Linguist at [Google](https://www.google.com). Before that, I completed an MA degree in Linguistics at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu).

One of my primary research areas is theoretical syntax. In the theoretical domain, my interests include:
1. Case (especially Quirky case)
2. Agreement (especially agreement 'failures')
3. Word order (especially V2)
4. How 1-3 interact with each other

My other main research area is computational linguistics. In the computational domain, my interests include:
1. Developing computational tools for low-resource languages
2. Applying computational methods to theoretical linguistic research
3. Applying theoretical linguistic knowledge to computational linguistics problems

Some languages I am interested in:
- Breton
- Scottish Gaelic
- Icelandic
- Faroese
- Kashmiri
- Ingush
- Tohono O'odham
- Romansh
